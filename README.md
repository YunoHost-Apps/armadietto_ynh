> considered experimental.  As with any alpha-stage storage technology, you

> labelled stable.

## Disclaimers / important information

### Important Notes
RemoteStorage requires a dedicated domain, so obtain one and add it using the YunoHost admin panel. **Domains -> Add domain**. As RemoteStorage uses the full domain and is installed on the root, you can create a subdomain such as remote.domain.tld. Don't forget to update your DNS if you manage them manually.

RemoteStorage requires browser-approved SSL certificates. If you have certificates not issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), install them manually as usual.
